This project has multiple scenes, scoring, local user data for storing high scores, touch/click to make the ball fly, physics and collision detection to score points or initiate game over, sound effects, and background music.  The pipes spawn from the left with varying speeds and the pipe gaps move either up or down also with varying speeds.  The ball floats up and is clicked to bring it down.  The ball cannot be continuously click to make it move.  There is a delay on the action and a new click will not register until the ball begins to fall again.',
